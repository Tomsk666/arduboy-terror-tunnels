<h1>Tunnel Terror - by Tom Millichamp & Jamie Millichamp</h1>

<h3>Background</h3>
You are stuck in a never ending tunnel looking for treasure - 3 Gold Chalices!
You have to find all 3 then beat Zarc, the demonic monster, to Win!

<h3>Instructions</h3>
You have the following:
<ul>
<li>S:	Strength (Needed for battles with aliens). Max Strength=10</li>
<li>H:	Health (Stamina)</li>
<li>L:	Lives (start with 3)</li>
<li>C:	Chalices (you need to collect all 3 to win!)</li>
<li>i:	This will appear if you carry invincibility potion</li>
<li>2:	This will appear if you carry double power potion</li>
</ul>
You can gain strength by finding things like swords, shields etc. behind doors.
You can gain health/stamina by finding things like food, drink etc. behind doors.
Chalices can also be found behind doors, but so can monsters!
Chalices give you a strength AND stamina boost!
Monsters can also sometimes appear in your way in the tunnels, so be warned!

Simply move around looking in rooms to try & find items & the chalices. Moving around uses your health/stamina, so restore with food & drink. If your health/stamina gets to zero you will lose a strength point.

<h3>Moving</h3>
Use D-pad to move through corridors.
Opening doors - just go forward (Up on D-pad) to go through a door.
Most actions are A_BUTTON but you will be prompted, only exception is Block Attack (B_BUTTON)

<h3>Levels</h3>
There are 3 levels, which you progress through each time you find a chalice.
Monsters become harder to defeat at each level.

<h3>Potions</h3>
Invincibility potion! - If you gain this it stays with you until used. When you battle a monster, if you have this potion, you will be asked if you want to use it (you can only use once), if you do, you automatically win that battle!
Double Strength potion - this automatically gets used in the next battle. Each time you win a round, the alien loses 2 strength points instead of one!
Finding a potion also boosts your health by 1 point!

<h3>Battles</h3>
Battles are played with 2 dice. You always start first. 
Play starts with you rolling your first dice.
You then have a choice to continue & roll your second, or block the monsters next attack. If you block, the monster cannot beat you in that round, but you lose 1 Health point.
If your health is zero, then you cannot block.
Once you have rolled, the total of the two dice values + your health points make your total score.
The monster then rolls one dice, and he can also then decide to block or continue & roll his second.
At the end of the round whoever has the highest score wins and their opponent loses a Strength point.
If it is a draw, you both lose 1 health/stamina point each.
Rounds continue until either you or the monster lose all their strength.
If you win the battle then you steal some of the alienâ€™s original strength value, gain an extra health point and play continues. If you lose, you lose a life, and your strength & stamina get set back to 1.

<h3>Tactics</h3>
You need health to Block in Battles. BUT!! Health points are also added to your dice score in battle, so you need to use them judiciously! They are needed for attacking AND blocking - you decide which in each battle!
Keep invincibility for stronger aliens (or for challenging Zarc in the final battle!).
If you have invincibility AND double strength, save your invincibility for another battle.
If you have 2 chalices & invincibility - it may be worth keeping it to defeat Zarc!
